# Dictionary
This folder contains the code i had written to solve the problem presented to me by Sir. Matthew Campbell, here is what the problem said:
"Write a program that descrambles words. It can be any word in this dictionary. The scrambled word may be read from a file or stdin. The program must find all the words in the dictionary file that could match the scrambled word. The match must not be case sensitive."

So, i have implemented the following code (dictionary.c), which goes both strings, tries to find each and every character in both.
